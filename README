I. REQUIRED SOFTWARE

(1) Python 2.x
(2) PIL
(3) PyYAML

II. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT'S PARTS

Project contains two parts:

(1) make_samples.py - python script, that takes initial highr resolution image and produce
series of low resolution images

(2) sr_restore.py - python script, that takes series of low resolution images from (1) and
estimates high resolution image by using one of SR algorithm

There are plenty of factors, that aren't estimated in (2) instead they are just shared
between (1) and (2), those factors are stored in config.yaml There is no need to modify
this file.

Samples that may be used to check results of presented implementation may be obtained from
sample_images directory.

III. EXAMPLES OF USAGE
(1) creation of input images:
create images from image in sample_images/sky.tif, downscaled by 2:
    bash-3.2$ ./make_samples.py sample_images/sky.tif -s 2
