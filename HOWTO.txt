II. PROJECT SUBPARTS DESCRIPTION

Project contains two parts:

(1) create_input_samples.py - python script, that takes initial highr resolution image and
produce series of low resolution images

(2) sr_restore.py - python script, that takes series of low resolution images
from (1) and estimates high resolution image by using one of SR algorithm

There are plenty of factors, that aren't estimated in (2) instead they are just
shared between (1) and (2), those factors are stored in config.yaml There is no
need to modify this file.

Samples that may be used to check results of presented implementation may be
obtained from sample_images directory.
